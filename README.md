A TypeScript implementation of The X3DH Key Agreement Protocol.

This application is written in very small TypeScript code.
If you want to implement X3DH in your preferred programming language, it is better to look directly at the TypeScript code.

## Usage

```shell
# If you don't have a deno command (TypeScript Runtime)
curl -fsSL https://deno.land/install.sh | sh

# In your terminal shell
deno run x3dh.ts
```

Or

```shell
# If you don't have a tsc command (TypeScript Compiler)
npm init
npm install typescript

# Compile!
npx tsc
```

```javascript
// Open created x3dh.js and paste all codes in it to your browser's console and run the below.
main();
```
